# Chess-AI
A work in progress. I am writing a program to run a heuristic-minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play chess. I am using the chess library in python, but writing the code for the AI myself, and making it so a user can interactively play against the computer.

I am currently writing the heuristics for the program, which will determine how "good" or "bad" a move is.
