# Chess-AI
A work in progress. I am writing a program to run a heuristic-minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play chess. I am using the chess library in python, but writing the code for the AI myself, and making it so a user can interactively play against the computer.

I currently have it working. It can play either first or second, the user gets to choose. The user also can choose a depth for the minimax (5 takes a while, so anything beyond that might be a bad idea unless you're on a better computer or smth). I haven't gotten around to playing a full game with it yet. I need to add a few more hueristics to make it really good, but it does seem to be working pretty well so far.
